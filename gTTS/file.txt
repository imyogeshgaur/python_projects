Technology bought a revolutionary change in the life of humans, and here the most important work of any technology is to do the things in faster and precise manner.
The technology is the technology of computation of data, and the device use in this computation are called computers, however the computation can be done by various other devices also but they are also a form of computers only as all of them has a computational chip known as microprocessor.
The computers we use in today's world i.e from Personal Computer to Supercomputers all are based on a small hardware component that is called transistor, this component is used to build Central Processing Unit(CPU) or microprocessor of any device.The transistor here work as a switch and it perform flip-flops.
Due to these flip-flops, the machine has it's own numeric system that is binary numeric system that has two values or operators i.e 1 and 0 as you know already.The transistors used in the today world are so small that it is equivalent to atomic size.Now we all know that atom has 4 Quantum numbers i.e Principle, Orbital, Magnetic and Spin(POMS) Quantum numbers.
But now the things are going to change by changing the orientation type of spin quantum number of the atomic transistor, such that it has positive spin, negative spin and a bidirectional spin also that is positive and negative  simultaneously.Due to this change the smallest unit of data get changed from bits to Qubits.The computation machines based on these type of transistors are known as Quantum computers,which are much powerful and fast than modern supercomputers as it has immense parallelism,because of quantum properties like superposition and entanglement of Qubit.
